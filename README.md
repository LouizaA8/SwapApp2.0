 **THE PROBLEM**<br>
The fast fashion sector continues to perpetrate severe environmental degradation and social issues, particularly in developing nations where the majority of textile waste ends up. This project introduces a mobile application designed to promote sustainable fashion through an easy-to-use and convenient clothing swap platform.<br>
**TOOLS USED**<br>
The application was developed using Android Studio, with Java and XML managing the front-end user interface, while Firebase handles the back-end operations for secure authentication, real-time database management, and cloud storage. Cloudinary was integrated to manage user-uploaded images of clothing items, allowing users to visually showcase the clothes they want to swap. The Android Maps API was used to help users find potential swap partners in their locality.<br>
**FUNCTIONALITIES**<br>
Core functionalities include user registration and login, personalized user profiles, item listing with image uploads, messaging between users, swap requests, and AI-driven clothing condition evaluation. The project followed a hybrid development model that combines Agile flexibility with the structured planning of the Waterfall methodology.<br>
**CONCLUSION**<br>
This project demonstrates how technology can be leveraged to promote sustainable consumption in the fashion industry. By providing a platform where users can exchange clothes instead of purchasing new ones, the application not only extends the lifecycle of garments but also contributes to reducing textile waste. The addition of AI-powered condition analysis further builds user confidence in the swapping process. Overall, this application represents a meaningful step toward encouraging ethical, community-driven fashion consumption.<br>
